   * As of v2.0.0 the Datastore class extends node's built

   * plus additional error events. It also inherits the `compaction.done`
   * event from nedb but for consistency, in this library the event
   * was renamed to `compactionDone`.
   *
   * All event callbacks will be passed the same type of values,
   * the first being the datastore, then the operation result (if there is any)
   * and then the arguments of the called method. (Check out the first example!)
   *
   * All events have a matching error event that goes by the name of `${method}Error`,
   * for example `findError` or `loadError`. The callbacks of these events will receive
   * the same parameters as the normal event handlers except that instead of the 
   * operation result there will be an operation error. (Check out the second example!)
   *
   * A generic `__error__` event is also available. This event will be emitted at any of
   * the above error events. The callbacks of this event will receive the same parameters
   * as the specific error event handlers except that there will be one more parameter 
   * passed between the datastore and the error object, that being the name of the method
   * that failed. (Check out the third example!)
   *
   * @example
   * let datastore = Datastore.create()
   * datastore.on('update', (datastore, result, query, update, options) => {
   * })
   * datastore.on('load', (datastore) => {
   *     // this event doesn't have a result
   * })
   * datastore.on('ensureIndex', (datastore, options) => {
   *     // this event doesn't have a result
   *     // but it has the options argument which will be passed to the
   *     // event handlers
   * })
   * datastore.on('compactionDone', (datastore) => {
   *     // inherited from nedb's compaction.done event
   * })
   *
   * @example
   * let datastore = Datastore.create()
   * datastore.on('updateError', (datastore, error, query, update, options) => {
   * })
   * datastore.on('loadError', (datastore, error) => {
   * })
   * datastore.on('ensureIndexError', (datastore, error, options) => {
   * })

   * let datastore = Datastore.create()
